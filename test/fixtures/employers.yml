# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  email: "employer@example.com"
  encrypted_password: <%= Employer.new.send(:password_digest, 'password1234') %>

two:
  email: "employer2@example.com"
  encrypted_password: <%= Employer.new.send(:password_digest, 'password1234') %>
